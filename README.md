# 🚀 Development Hub Internship - Week 3

## 🔍 Advanced Security & Final Reporting  
This repository contains the security tasks completed during **Week 3** of the Development Hub internship. The focus was on **penetration testing, secure logging, and security best practices.**

---

## 📌 Task Overview
### 1️⃣ Basic Penetration Testing
Conducted security testing using **Nmap** and browser-based methods:
- ✅ **Port Scanning**: Identified open ports and services using Nmap.
- ✅ **XSS Testing**: Checked for input vulnerabilities in the web application.
- ✅ **Security Headers Analysis**: Evaluated HTTP headers for weaknesses.

### 2️⃣ Secure Logging with Winston
Implemented **structured logging** using the Winston library to track security events.
```javascript
const winston = require('winston');
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'security.log' })
  ]
});
logger.info('Application started');
```
🔹 **Next Steps:** Implement log rotation to prevent excessive log sizes.

### 3️⃣ Security Best Practices Checklist
A simple security checklist covering key areas:
✅ Validate all inputs to prevent injections.
✅ Enforce HTTPS for secure data transmission.
✅ Use hashed & salted passwords for authentication.
✅ Secure HTTP headers to prevent exploits.
✅ Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
